# Graph-Path-Assembler
This repository contains an assembly language program that implements path and loop search algorithms in a graph. The program supports input of the graph description from a file and from the keyboard, as well as visualization of the original graph and results

Main features:

- Input of graph description:
    * From file: the program can read the graph description from a text file.
    * From keyboard: the program allows you to enter the graph description manually.
- Graph representation:
    * The program visualizes the original graph in graphical form.
- Path Finding:
    * Finding the shortest path between two given vertices.
    * Finds the shortest path that passes through a given edge and a given vertex.
- Loop search:
    * Finding a cycle in a graph.
- Visualization of results:
    * Output the found path or cycle in graphical form.
